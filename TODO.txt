Version1: Let the site be bare min n good with most necessary info

1) Main things:
- Button falling out (issue identified but dk the soln yet): can put animations up down mode...
- save resources links (flip cards, animations)
- footer (reserver rights or made by me)
- seo, image optimization, etc
- volunteer section, work exp, etc
- search
- for cards: can I put the data at 1 place and populate it in all cards? is that a good idea? 

2) Mini changes
- make my image smaller (currently used margin)
- Different hamburget menu?
- Proper images (it can enhance the site significatly)
- better logos
- margin and padding issues

3) Take people's opinion n improve!

This is a simple portfolio made with the skills I leart back then. I'll make a much better and creative site soon.
